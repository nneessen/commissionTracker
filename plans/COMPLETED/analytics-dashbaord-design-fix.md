in the analytics page, in the header we currently displaying the page heading which i like. however the main content of this page is pushed down to far. it would look better if the time period selector was in the same row as the heading.
and all the sections are brought up as a result.

also you really need to reevaluate how you styled/designed the dividers between the Heading and the card content. you have several glaring obvious issues and im not
sure how you let that fly. but are you not using a reusable component for all the sections for the divider, bc if you were then every single one of those sections would have an identical heading
and we wouldn't have any styling issues, so please review all of that and fix it
