this is not the final plan. you will be responsible for coming up with the plan

this will need a plan for each feature directory.
must include each file and each sub-dir and files w/in each sub-dir all components, and what html being return in this component, can be replace with a re-usable component from src/compoennts/ui/..

- each component must be compatible for dark/light mode and neither must not have transparent backgrounds.
- each component must only use shadcn components
- each shadcn component in src/components/ui/ must not be the exact installed component when installing via npx.
- each component must be refactored to makee the component original to this app
- dark mode - the dark colors need to be like a modern dark grayish color
- make sure my index.css is built proper to account for both light and dark mode, and that when in either mode, fonts and borders, and everything else are the correct colors theyre suppose to be

- make sure our re-usable components have the necessry props need for this app.

- anaylitics, auth, commissions, comps, dsahboard, expenses, policies, and settings are all the features that need this done to.
- do not be lazy
- do not skip steps
- review all the code you need to review first.
- do not over-engineer
- do not have shortsighted vision and only do things minimially.
- for example make sure you're review the components entirely, like if you see a card and theres a manual html coded card within it or input or button etc, this should neveer occur. there should
  never be any manual html in any component.

make sure you're not hardcoding he codes and were using color-brand-100-900 etc.

- do not assume you know what the contents are of any dir, file, class, method, etc.
- do not assume you know my schema. hint: pull first if needed
- do not assume you know my types. hint: database.types.ts - also not even sure why you created all the extar types when we could have simply only used database.types for the majority of all types
  aside from manual extra one.
