we need to greatly enhance the login/signup page, which i thought we already did, after we made a pretty awesome recruiting link public url page, https://www.thestandardhq.com/join-the-standard

the way those pages were styled pre-post form submission are awesome, and thats how i want the login page design. I need the main logo and the name of my agency to be more prominent, and
out of this world awesome! i have dark and light letter logos to use, and my agecy name is "The Standard"
