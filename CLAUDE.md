# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a commission tracking application project. The codebase is currently empty and ready for initial development.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the technology stack and build system have not yet been established. When development begins:

1. Initialize the appropriate package manager (npm, yarn, pip, etc.) based on the chosen technology stack
2. Set up the initial project structure
3. Configure development tooling (linting, formatting, testing)

## Architecture Notes

This project will likely need:

- Database layer for storing commission data, client information, and payment records
- Business logic for commission calculations and tracking
- User interface for data entry and reporting
- Authentication and authorization for secure access

## Future Development Commands

Once the project structure is established, update this file with:

- Build commands (`npm run build`, `make build`, etc.)
- Development server commands (`npm run dev`, `python manage.py runserver`, etc.)
- Testing commands (`npm test`, `pytest`, etc.)
- Linting and formatting commands
- Database migration or setup commands if applicable

## Project-Specific Considerations

- Commission tracking typically involves sensitive financial data - ensure proper security measures
- Consider data backup and recovery strategies
- Plan for reporting and analytics features
- Account for different commission structures (percentage, flat rate, tiered, etc.)
