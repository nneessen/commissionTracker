Training Hub

-- email template creation
-- workflows/sequences - manual, automated, triggered, events, webhhooks

How will this actually be implemented and how is this used? Is this connect to the email services? or notifications services?

Does this actually even work?

Who has permission to use these?

How can you verify these automations actually work?

how are events determined and where do these events come from?

webhooks?

why is there a workflow-wizard folder? this is not how my project directory tree is architected.

missing edge cases?

any critical bugs? potential sqsl injections?
