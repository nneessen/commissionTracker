this folder and all files in it is not how a real project would be organized.

organize this better so im not looking at a dozen files with various responsibilites

clean it up.

check for duplicate code

check for missing edge cases

check to see if there are US_STATES constants/vars in other files that could be importing from one US_STATES constant file
