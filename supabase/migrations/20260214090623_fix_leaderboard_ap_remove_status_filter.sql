-- supabase/migrations/20260214090623_fix_leaderboard_ap_remove_status_filter.sql
-- Fix all leaderboards: AP should have NO status filter, just submit_date filtering
--
-- User requirement: "statuses don't matter - we track AP by submit date regardless of policy status"
--
-- Business Logic:
--   IP = Active policies with effective_date in range
--   AP = ALL policies (any status) with submit_date in range
