# Migration Revert Files

This directory contains SQL files to revert migrations.

## Naming Convention

Revert files should be named: `<migration-name>_revert.sql`

For example, if your migration is `20251223_001_add_feature.sql`,
the revert file should be `20251223_001_add_feature_revert.sql`

## Usage

```bash
./scripts/revert-migration.sh 20251223_001_add_feature
```

## Best Practices

1. Create a revert file BEFORE applying a migration
2. Test the revert in a development environment first
3. Revert files should be idempotent when possible
4. After reverting, always regenerate types:
   ```bash
   npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id pcyaqwodnyrpkaiojnpz > src/types/database.types.ts
   ```
